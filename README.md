# Introduction to C++

---

Created by Bjarne Stroustrup, 1979 as "C with Classes"

In 1983 it was renamed to C++ and added:

* Virtual functions
* function name and operator overloading,  references
* const
* //single line comments

By the 1990's, C++ had the fastest growing community with widespread use of Graphical User Interface and Object Oriented Progrramming \(OOP\).

By 1998, the first C++ standard was adopted, which included the Standard Template Library.

C++ is a superset of C

All libraries from C are used in C++

Resource handling is much improved

Higher-level Concepts sucha s generic programming are now possible

They also share all of the same short-comings

User-defined C++ types are difficult to integrate with old C.
