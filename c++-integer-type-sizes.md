# C++ Type Sizes

---

### Integer Type Sizes

**If you want guaranteed type sizes include: **

```
<cstdint>
```

**This header provides the following types:**

* uint32\_t
* uint8\_t
* int64\_t
* uintfast16\_t

### Floating point Type Sizes

**Float** - single precision. Usually IEEE-754 32-bit floating point type.

**Double** - double precision. Usually IEEE-754 64-bitfloating point type.

**Long Double** - extended precision.

* Doesn't have to map to an IEEE-754 type.
* Usually 80-bit x87 floating point type on x86-64 machines.
