# Headers and Source

**All of your knowledge from C translated to C++:**

* Put exported functionality in header \(.h\) files
* _\#include_ imported functionality from other headers
* Put implementation details in source fiels \(**.cpp**, not **.c**\)
* Do not use the **\#using** directive in a header
