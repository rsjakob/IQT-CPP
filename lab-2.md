# Lab 2

---

Provided a text file, use the STL to read from it and count each occurrence of each word. Once complete, output to **stdout **each word, and the number of times it occurred.

You will write this program in its entirety. There will be no source code provided by the instructor, only a text file containing the input.

The instructional goal of this lab is to give you practice using the STL. Use _STL containers_, _algorithms_, and \_iterators \_where they would be helpful.
